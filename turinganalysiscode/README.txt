Unfortunately this code is not really commented that well for question please email kmmarti@illinois.edu.
plotParams.m is a plot of the estimated parameters for the reduced model.
lengthScale.m and turing.m are for some analysis of the pictures, producing both characteristics of spot size and area and the powerspectrum for turing.m.
The folder SizeCharac gives some more code for analysis of Tings stochastic simulation and a few different runs of it.
The Analysis folder contains the code for the analytics of the power spectrum for the detailed model and also the code for the sensitivity analysis, phase diagram, and the hypercube sampling of parameter space.
